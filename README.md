# UninstallMAU
An easy way to uninstall Microsoft AutoUpdate on macOS. Created with [Packages](http://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html).

# Why does it use .pkg format?
This project only uses a shell script to delete Microsoft AutoUpdate, and it doesn't modify other parts of the system.

In case some people have little knowledge of shell script, I packed it in a .pkg package. All you need is to "install" it like other softwares. 

To find out the shell script, see `clean.sh` in the code above. 

# How to use
1. Download the latest release of UninstallMAU (.pkg format);
2. Double click it and install;
3. Done.
